I am an undergraduate student at McGill University studying computer science and artificial intelligence with a 
minor in mathematics. I have been affiliated with Mila - Quebec AI Institute since April 2023 supervised by Prof. Irina 
Rish. 

My research focuses on training and interpreting largescale multimodal foundation models. 

This is motivated by contributing to what I believe is the greatest technical problem of our time: building safe AGI.

I briefly worked in quantitative finance applying reinforcement learning to develop trading models.
