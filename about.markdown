I am an undergraduate student at McGill University studying computer science and artificial intelligence with a 
minor in mathematics. I have been affiliated with Mila - Quebec AI Institute since April 2023 supervised by Prof. Irina 
Rish. 

I am extremely motivated to contribute to what I believe is the greatest technical problem of our time: building safe AGI.

I consider myself part of the effective altruism and rationalist communities. 

I briefly worked in quantitative finance applying reinforcement learning to develop trading models.
